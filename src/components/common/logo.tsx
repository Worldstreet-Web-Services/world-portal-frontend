 * The E-Embassy mark.
 *
 * Two files rather than a CSS filter: the wordmark is near-black and would
 * disappear on the hero photograph and the black footer, and a filter that
 * lifted it would also flatten the blue, cyan and gold of the swoosh. The
 * light variant recolours only the type.
 *
 * The mark is deliberately static. It sits in the fixed header on every page,
 * so anything that moves here moves in the corner of the eye for the whole
 * session — the swoosh already reads as motion standing still.
